# Mouse

## Overview

Supports a script syntax that may be run from a command-line.

## Commands

### RUN

`run` is the rubber and your OS is the road. It runs a chained sequence of methods that we call a script. The script is specified by you. It may be inline or read from a file.

#### The Script
The language supported for script processing is a subset of `javascript`. But it is isolated to function calls, params of any known javascript type and chaining.
